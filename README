SimpleModelSearch
=================

Adds search method to ActiveRecord::Base.

The query language supports the operators (), not, and, or.

Precedence in that order.
- is an alias for not.
If no operator is present, and is assumed. Lastly, anything within double quotes is treated as a single search term.

For example,
 ruby rails => records where both ruby and rails appear
 "ruby on rails" => records where "ruby on rails" appears
 ruby or rails => records where ruby or rails (or both) appears
 ruby or chunky bacon => records where ruby appears or both chunky and bacon appear
 not dead or alive => records where alive appears or dead is absent
 -(ruby or rails) => records where neither ruby nor rails appears
 (ruby or rails) -"ruby on rails" => records where ruby or rails appears but not the phrase "ruby on rails"

Adds several methods to all model objects.

def self.searches_on(*args)
	Allow the user to set the default searchable fields.
	By default, search will search all string and text fields. Use this to limit what is searched on.

def self.search(text = nil, options = {})
	Search the model's text and string fields
	  text = a set of words to search for
	  :only => an array of fields in which to search for the text;
	    default is 'all text or string columns'
	  :except => an array of fields to exclude
	    from the default searchable columns
	  :include => an array of tables to include in the joins.  Fields that
	    have searchable text will automatically be included in the default
	    set of :search_columns.
	  :join_include => an array of tables to include in the joins, but only
	    for joining. (Searchable fields will not automatically be included.)
	  :conditions => a string of additional conditions (constraints)
	  :keywords => true if searches for keyword vs fragment. Default is false.
	  :order => sort order (order_by SQL snippet)
	  :page => page desired. use 0 to return everything. Defaults to 1.

	  returns WillPaginate::Collection
